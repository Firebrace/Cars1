    <p>A W configuration engine is a piston engine with three banks of cylinders arranged in a W-shaped configuration. This design is a variation of the V configuration with an additional set of cylinders, resulting in a more complex but potentially more powerful engine.</p>
    <p>While less common than V configuration engines, W configuration engines have been used in certain high-performance cars and aircraft.</p>
