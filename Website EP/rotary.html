    <p>A rotary engine is a type of internal combustion engine with a unique design that features a triangular rotor that rotates within a housing. This design allows for smooth and high-revving operation. Rotary engines are known for their compact size, high power-to-weight ratio, and smooth power delivery.</p>
    <p>Despite their advantages, rotary engines also have drawbacks such as poor fuel efficiency and high emissions. They are commonly found in certain sports cars and aircraft due to their lightweight and high power output.</p>
