    <p>A radial engine is a reciprocating type internal combustion engine configuration in which the cylinders radiate outward from a central crankcase like the spokes of a wheel. Radial engines are often used in aircraft, and they offer good cooling, easy maintenance, and high reliability.</p>
    <p>Radial engines were widely used in aviation during the early to mid-20th century, particularly in military aircraft like the famous World War II-era fighters such as the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and the Supermarine Spitfire.</p>
