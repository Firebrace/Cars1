  <div class="content">
    <p>An opposed-piston engine is a type of internal combustion engine in which each cylinder has a piston at both ends, and no cylinder head. This design results in fewer moving parts, reduced heat loss, and improved thermal efficiency.</p>
    <p>Opposed-piston engines have been used in various applications, including marine propulsion, stationary power generation, and military vehicles. They are known for their simplicity, reliability, and fuel efficiency.</p>
